A primary point in this struct is `load_config(&mut self, config: &Configuration) -> Result<(), String>` which takes a `config::Configuration` struct and tries to instantiate all configured instances. While doing so it has to load DNA files referenced in the configuration. In order to not bind this code to the assumption that there is a filesystem and also enable easier testing, a DnaLoader ()which is a closure that returns a Dna object for a given path string) has to be injected on creation."]]});
