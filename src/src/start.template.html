                                    <p>
                                        When you go to Github, look for one of the downloads that starts with "cli".
                                        <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/releases/tag/{{version}}"

                                    <p>
                                        Once you've downloaded it, unpack it, RENAME it "hc" and move the resulting
                                        folder to a directory on your computer where you'd like to keep these files
                                        long term.
                                        As a default, lets assume that it can be this folder called "hc", right under
                                        your $HOME or %USERPROFILE% (your user) directory.
                                        Now we will have to add this directory to your PATH variable, so that the
                                        binary becomes available within your command line. The instructions for this
                                        differ, depending on your platform. If you need help with this, read the
                                        relevant <a href="#paths-help-section">Help with PATHs</a> section at the
                                        bottom of this page.

                                    <p>
                                        To confirm that you have them installed, try running the following
                                        command, which should result in it printing the version of the tools that you downloaded:
                                        <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>hc --version</code></p>
                                        </div>
                                        Congratulations!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Note that you've installed the minimum necessary to start developing with Holochain.
                                        You have enough installed to generate a new Holochain project from scratch! To do additional
                                        things with it, you will need to make sure you have the additional dependencies mentioned below.
                                        Relevant feedback will also be given through the use of the commands, so don't be afraid to try things out.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        As a next step, try running the following command to familiarize with the tools:
                                        <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>hc help</code></p>
                                        </div>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To generate your first Holochain project folder, run:
                                        <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>hc init my_first_app</code></p>
                                        </div>
                                        In the new "my_first_app" folder is the basic structure of a new Holochain project, congratulations! Open it up
                                        in a file browser or text editor to start to check it out.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To get started beyond this, you will need to jump ahead to the <a class="scrollto" href="#development-prereq-packaging">code generation prerequisite</a> and follow those instructions, diving a layer deeper into Holochain development.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you've completed that, you will be able to generate a new "Zome", the basic module format for Holochain.
                                        To try it, make sure your terminal is set to the directory of "my_first_app" and then run:
                                        <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>hc generate zomes/my_zome</code></p>
                                        </div>
                                        This will add some starter code into the "zomes/my_zome" sub folder, which you can open up in a text editor and
                                        start checking out!
                                        That's the quick start. To go further, you may want to check out a

                                        If you are generating new Zomes, developing new code, or wish to "package" code that someone else wrote,
                                        you will need to install Rust. To "package" the code means to compile or build all
                                        the source code into WebAssembly from its native language, and then aggregate it
                                        into a Holochain "DNA" file. This can be read about further in the
                                        <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/building_apps.html" target="_blank">Guidebook</a>.

                                    <p>
                                        Commands that invoke the Rust dependencies include <code>hc generate</code>, <code>hc test</code>, <code>hc run --package</code>, and
                                        <code>hc package</code>. Use of any of these commands will require Rust to be installed. Other commands
                                        can be run without the installation of Rust.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The recommended way to write Holochain applications is to use the "Holochain
                                        Development Kit" (HDK).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The HDK allows generation of low level web assembly (WASM) code with convenience
                                        functions written in the high level Rust language.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the future there will be HDKs written to a variety of languages, but for now you
                                        will need to install and maybe learn some Rust.

                                        We are using a "nightly" release of the Rust langauge.<br />
                                        The Rust community moves very quickly so we "pin" to a specific version to ensure a
                                        relatively stable working environment.<br />
                                        <strong>Only the pinned nightly version of Rust is compatible with
                                            Holochain</strong>

                                            Once you have rust successfully installed, you need to install the
                                            "nightly-{{rust_version}}" toolchain of rust. This means having the specific version
                                            of
                                            the tools, which are required for working with Holochain. In a
                                            terminal, run:
                                            <div class="code-block">
                                                <p><code>rustup toolchain install nightly-{{rust_version}}</code></p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Add WebAssembly Support</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Since Holochain code needs to be in WebAssembly, the Rust compilation "target"
                                        for WebAssembly is required.
                                        This just means that the Rust toolchain knows how to compile Rust code to
                                        WebAssembly.
                                        You will likely need to restart your terminal, or open a new one, before being
                                        able to run the following command.
                                        In a terminal, run:

                                        End-to-end testing of Holochain apps is done in Javascript executed by Nodejs.
                                        The command to run these tests is <code>hc test</code>.
                                        <br />
                                        If you want to use <code>hc test</code> you will need to have nodejs installed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Holochain supports nodejs versions in the 8, 10, and 11 ranges
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To check the currently installed node version run: <br />
    
                                        <p>
                                            <code>node -v</code><br />
                                        </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If you don't have a supported nodejs version you can find installation

                                        start up

                                        When you go to Github, look for one of the downloads that starts with
                                        "conductor".
                                        <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/releases/tag/{{version}}"

                                    <p>
                                        Once you've downloaded it, unpack it, RENAME it "holochain" and move
                                        the resulting
                                        folder to a directory on your computer where you'd like to keep these files
                                        long term.
                                        As a default, lets assume that it can be this folder called
                                        "holochain", right under
                                        your $HOME or %USERPROFILE% (your user) directory.
                                        Now we will have to add this directory to your PATH variable, so that the
                                        binary becomes available within your command line. The instructions for this
                                        differ, depending on your platform. If you need help with this, read the

                                                discussed, but it could apply equally and additionally to
                                                $HOME/holochain.
                                                In general, follow this pattern for adding any folder to your PATH. As

                                                is
                                                discussed, but it could apply equally and additionally to

                                                In general, follow this pattern for adding any folder to your PATH. As
